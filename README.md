# eggplantpasta.github.io

This project is aiming to migrate my [Github Pages blog](http://eggplantpasta.github.io/) from Jekyll to Eleventy.

## Jekyll

My [walkthrough](http://eggplantpasta.github.io/articles/jekyll-and-github-pages/) of getting started with Jekyll on GitHub Pages.

## Eleventy

For the moment I'm following instructions from the readme of the [eleventy base blog](README-eleventy-base-blog.md).

[This article, Eleventy and Github pages](https://lea-tortay.com/content/writings/github-pages-eleventy/), goes over some the deploy methods.
